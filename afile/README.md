# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Final Project

## Group Members: Shreyans Rishi, Matthew Cardy, Ayesha Farkhundah, Chen Pi  
Our group designed a Object identification AI  
In order to create the model use the program model.py, currently at 80% accuracy, increase the epoch size in the file to increase accuracy.

Note: Increasing the number of epochs will take a long time for the model to train. Tensorflow-GPU is recommended for that. 

After the model has been created run the program test.py to identify objects
